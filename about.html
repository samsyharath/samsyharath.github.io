I am a Laotian-American actor, director, teacher, and theatre producer currently living in Portland, Oregon. Originally from Arkansas, I received a BA in Theatre Arts from the University of Arkansas Fort Smith. I moved to Portland in 2011 to study at the Portland Actors Conservatory. I then helped start Theatre Diaspora, a project of MediaRites that is committed to fiercely celebrating and creatively advocating for the Asian American/Pacific Islander experience through stage work.

As many people say, theatre is a reflection of life. I believe that the key to equity and equal respect in everyday life can be swayed by visibility and representation in media and on stage.
All voices should be heard, all stories should be told. I work diligently with <a href="https://theatrediaspora.org">Theatre Diaspora</a> to have the voices of Asian American/Pacific Islander artists heard and strive to engage artists and audience members.
